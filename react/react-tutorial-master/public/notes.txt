*  By surrounding a JavaScript expression in braces inside JSX (as either an attribute or child), you can drop text or React components into the tree
*  We access named attributes passed to the component as keys on this.props
*  To implement interactions, we introduce mutable state to the component. this.state is private to the component and can be changed by calling this.setState()
* getInitialState() executes exactly once during the lifecycle of the component and sets up the initial state of the component
	<CommentList data={this.state.data}
* componentDidMount is a method called automatically by React after a component is rendered for the first time. The key to dynamic updates is the call to this.setState()
*  In React, components should always represent the state of the view and not only at the point of initialization.
